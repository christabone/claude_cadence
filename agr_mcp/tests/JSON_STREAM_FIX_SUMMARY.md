# JSON Stream Monitor Fix Summary

## Overview
Fixed critical issues in the `SimpleJSONStreamMonitor` class that were causing valid agent JSON output to be incorrectly parsed or marked as invalid.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. State Management Bug (HIGH Priority)
**Problem**: The `last_json_object` was being set on first valid match and returning early, preventing better matches from being found.

**Solution**:
- Collect ALL valid JSON candidates before selecting one
- Use a simple "last valid wins" strategy (representing the most recent/final state)
- Only update `last_json_object` once after evaluating all candidates
- This ensures the most appropriate JSON is selected when multiple valid options exist

### 2. Inefficient & Fragile Regex Patterns (HIGH Priority)
**Problem**: Regex patterns were compiled on every call and made brittle assumptions about JSON structure.

**Solution**:
- Pre-compiled all regex patterns at module level for performance
- Implemented a proper balanced-brace parser (`_extract_json_object`) that handles:
  - Nested JSON objects and arrays
  - Strings with escaped quotes
  - Whitespace variations
- Added robust escaped JSON handling with `unicode_escape` decoder
- Used simpler patterns for finding JSON start positions

### 3. Multi-line JSON Buffering Issue (HIGH Priority)
**Problem**: Only started buffering lines that BEGIN with '{' or '[', missing JSON that starts mid-line.

**Solution**:
- Use `str.find()` to detect JSON start characters anywhere in the line
- Extract and buffer only from the JSON start position (discarding prefix text)
- Implemented `JSONDecoder.raw_decode()` for proper multi-line parsing
- Handles mixed content gracefully (e.g., "Processing... {"status": "ok"}")

## Test Coverage

### Original Agent Tests (5 tests)
- Escaped JSON in assistant messages
- JSON embedded in summary text
- Markdown fenced JSON blocks
- Multiple JSON objects (correct selection)
- Help requested flag preservation

### Improvement Tests (7 tests)
- JSON starting mid-line
- Multi-line JSON with prefix text
- Deeply nested JSON objects
- Multiple JSON on same line
- Arrays starting mid-line
- Unicode escaped JSON
- Performance with large JSON

## Key Improvements

1. **Robustness**: Handles all common JSON embedding scenarios in agent output
2. **Performance**: Pre-compiled regex patterns and efficient string searching
3. **Correctness**: Proper JSON boundary detection using `raw_decode()`
4. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of extraction strategies and candidate validation

## Implementation Highlights

- Module-level pre-compiled regex patterns
- Balanced brace parser for accurate JSON extraction
- Multiple extraction strategies working in harmony
- Proper state management with single update point
- Comprehensive test suite with real-world examples

All tests pass successfully, confirming the fixes resolve the reported issues.
