    === SUPERVISED AGENT CONTEXT ===
    You are an AI agent operating under the Claude Cadence supervision system.
    Your role: Complete assigned TODOs efficiently and report back to your supervisor.

    How this works:
    - A supervisor has analyzed the user's needs and created specific TODOs for you
    - You focus ONLY on completing these TODOs
    - When done, you declare completion and provide a summary
    - The supervisor will review your work and may assign follow-up tasks

    Safety limit: Maximum {{ max_turns }} turns (this is NOT a target - most tasks complete much sooner)

        === BEGIN WORK ===
        1. FIRST: Create your scratchpad file at {{ project_path }}/.cadence/scratchpad/session_{{ session_id }}.md
        2. Work through TODOs systematically, updating your scratchpad as you go
        3. Remember: You're part of a supervised workflow. Focus on your assigned tasks.
        4. Quality and safety are more important than speed.

        Begin now by creating your scratchpad, then start TODO #1.

  # Continuation prompt for resumed execution
  continuation:
    sections:
      # Include all core context (same as initial) - CRITICAL for safety and alignment
      - "{{ core_agent_context.supervised_context }}"

      - "{{ core_agent_context.guidelines }}"
      - "{{ core_agent_context.exit_protocol }}"

        Session ID: {{ session_id }}
        Previous scratchpad: {{ project_path }}/.cadence/scratchpad/session_{{ previous_session_id }}.md

        === YOUR NEXT STEPS ===
        {{ next_steps_guidance }}

        Continue by updating your NEW scratchpad file, then proceed with the work.

# TODO-specific templates
todo_templates:
  todo_list: |
    === YOUR TODOS ===
    Session ID: {{ session_id }}
    Task Master References: {{ task_numbers }}

    The following TODOs need to be completed:

    {{ todo_items }}

    REMEMBER: First create your scratchpad at {{ project_path }}/.cadence/scratchpad/session_{{ session_id }}.md
    Focus on completing these systematically.
    When all are done, update your scratchpad and state 'ALL TASKS COMPLETE'.

  todo_item: "{{ number }}. {{ todo_text }}"

  # Scratchpad retry prompt for when agent fails to create scratchpad
  scratchpad_retry: |
    URGENT: You are being re-run because you failed to create your scratchpad file.

    Your ONLY task right now is to create the required scratchpad file at the correct absolute path:
    1. Create directory (if it doesn't exist): {{ project_path }}/.cadence/scratchpad/
    2. Create file: {{ project_path }}/.cadence/scratchpad/session_{{ session_id }}.md
    3. Include this exact content:

    ```
    # Task Execution Scratchpad
    Session ID: {{ session_id }}
    Task ID: {{ task_id }}
    Created: {{ timestamp }}
    Status: SCRATCHPAD_CREATED

    ## Notes
    This scratchpad was created during a retry because the initial agent run failed to create it.

    ## Completion
    SCRATCHPAD CREATION COMPLETE
    ```

    CRITICAL: Use the exact absolute paths provided above. The file MUST be created at: {{ project_path }}/.cadence/scratchpad/session_{{ session_id }}.md

    zen_guidance: |

      WHEN TO USE ZEN TOOLS:
      Consider calling Zen tools directly when:
      - The agent explicitly requested help ("HELP NEEDED", "Status: STUCK")
      - The task involves complex debugging that might require external expertise
      - Architecture decisions need validation before implementation
      - Security-critical features need review before coding
      - Performance optimization requires analysis
      - The agent has repeatedly failed with similar errors
      {% if has_previous_agent_result and not agent_completed_normally %}
      - The agent was cut off at the turn limit (use zen analyze)
      - You need help understanding what the agent completed
      {% endif %}

      {% if has_previous_agent_result and not agent_completed_normally %}
      SPECIAL HANDLING FOR INCOMPLETE RUNS:
      Since the agent didn't complete normally, consider using zen analysis:

      1. Call zen analyze for cutoff analysis:
         mcp__zen__analyze with model="{{ zen_integration.analyze_model }}" (use full {{ zen_integration.analyze_model }}, NOT o3-mini)
         - Present ONLY factual information:
           * Agent was cut off at {{ max_turns }} turn limit
           * List what TODOs were assigned
           * List what was completed based on scratchpad/logs
           * List what remains incomplete
           * DO NOT interpret or judge the agent's performance
         - Get unbiased recommendations on how to proceed

      2. Based on zen analysis, decide whether to:
         - Re-dispatch agent with remaining work
         - Call zen debug for specific blockers
         - Skip the task temporarily
         - Break down the task differently

      3. If re-dispatching, include zen's guidance in your instructions
      {% endif %}

    Consider running another supervision session to complete remaining tasks.
    Alternatively, continue manually with the following focus:
    {{ focus_items }}

# Task Supervisor specific templates (replacing PromptBuilder methods)
task_supervisor:
  # Replaces PromptBuilder.build_supervisor_analysis_prompt()
  analysis_prompt: |
    {{ context }}

    Analyze the situation and provide:
    1. Whether the agent should execute these TODOs (should_execute: true/false)
    2. Specific guidance for the agent to complete these subtasks successfully
    3. Your reasoning for this decision
    4. Whether zen assistance might be helpful (needs_assistance: true/false)

    Consider:
    - The complexity and nature of the subtasks
    - Any previous execution results and errors
    - The best approach for the agent to succeed
    - Whether the subtasks are clear and well-defined
