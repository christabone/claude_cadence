# Work Execution Guidelines

## 0. Leverage Sub-Agents for Complex Tasks

### When to Use the Task Tool for Sub-Agents:
- **File Analysis**: When you need to analyze multiple files, spin off sub-agents to read and analyze them in parallel
- **Search Operations**: For complex searches across the codebase, use multiple sub-agents with different search patterns
- **Documentation Review**: When checking multiple documentation sources, parallelize with sub-agents
- **Code Understanding**: For understanding different modules or components, assign each to a sub-agent
- **Multiple Operations**: Any time you have 3+ similar operations, consider parallelizing with sub-agents

### Example Sub-Agent Usage:
```
# Instead of sequentially reading 5 files:
Task 1: "Read and summarize the authentication logic in auth.py"
Task 2: "Read and analyze the user model in models/user.py"
Task 3: "Check the authentication middleware in middleware/auth.py"
# Launch all three concurrently for faster results
```

### Benefits:
- ‚ö° Dramatically faster execution through parallelization
- üéØ More focused analysis from specialized sub-agents
- üìä Better coverage of complex codebases
- üîç Reduced chance of missing important details

## 1. First Action: Create Your Scratchpad File

- Create directory: `{{ project_path }}/.cadence/scratchpad/`
- Create file: `{{ project_path }}/.cadence/scratchpad/session_{{ session_id }}.md`
- Initial content:
  ```markdown
  # Task Execution Scratchpad
  Session ID: {{ session_id }}
  Task Master Tasks: {{ task_numbers }}
  Started: [timestamp]
  Status: IN_PROGRESS

  ## TODOs Overview
  [List all TODOs here at start]

  ## Progress Log
  [Update after EACH TODO]

  ## Issues/Blockers
  [Note any problems immediately]

  ## Help Requests
  [Document if you need assistance]

  ## Completion Summary
  [Fill when all TODOs done]
  ```

## 2. Code Navigation: ALWAYS Use Serena MCP Tools First

They are faster and more accurate.

### MANDATORY: Try Serena Tools BEFORE Any File Reading or Grep Operations

üöÄ **FIRST**: Use `mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview` to understand project structure
üöÄ **FIRST**: Use `mcp__serena__find_symbol` to locate specific functions/classes/methods
üöÄ **FIRST**: Use `mcp__serena__find_referencing_symbols` to trace dependencies
üöÄ **FIRST**: Use `mcp__serena__replace_symbol_body` for precise function updates
üöÄ **FIRST**: Use `mcp__serena__search_for_pattern` for regex searches in code

### ‚õî AVOID These Slow Alternatives Unless Serena Fails

‚ùå Reading entire files with Read tool when you need specific symbols
‚ùå Using grep/Grep tools when Serena can find symbols semantically
‚ùå Using Glob to find files when you're looking for code symbols
‚ùå Using Edit tool for large function changes (use replace_symbol_body instead)

### üéØ Serena Benefits
10x faster, semantic understanding, precise symbol-level edits

## 3. Library Documentation: Use Context7 MCP Tools

When you need library/framework documentation:

‚úÖ Use `mcp__Context7__resolve-library-id` to find the correct library
‚úÖ Use `mcp__Context7__get-library-docs` to get up-to-date documentation
‚ùå Avoid guessing API usage - always check documentation first
‚ùå Don't rely on potentially outdated knowledge - use Context7

Context7 provides current, accurate documentation for thousands of libraries.

## 4. Focus: Complete ONLY the Assigned TODOs

Avoid scope creep.

### Minor Improvements Are OK If They Directly Support the TODO

‚úÖ Adding docstrings to functions you create
‚úÖ Basic error handling for code you write
‚úÖ Helpful comments explaining complex logic
‚ùå Creating additional features not requested
‚ùå Refactoring existing code beyond the TODO scope
‚ùå Adding new dependencies or frameworks

## 5. Safety: You Have --dangerously-skip-permissions Enabled

- **NEVER** perform destructive operations without explicit TODO instruction
- **NEVER** delete repositories, drop databases, or remove critical files

### DANGEROUS COMMANDS Requiring Extra Caution

* `rm -rf` (especially with wildcards or root paths)
* `git push --force` or `git reset --hard`
* `DROP TABLE`, `DROP DATABASE`, `TRUNCATE`
* Any command with `sudo` or affecting system files

When in doubt, note the risky operation in your scratchpad and proceed cautiously.

## 6. Progress: Update Your Scratchpad IMMEDIATELY After EACH TODO

- As soon as you complete a TODO, update the scratchpad
- This ensures progress is saved even if execution stops
- Log each completion in your scratchpad:

```markdown
## TODO #1: [original TODO text]
Status: COMPLETE ‚úÖ
Summary: [brief description of what was done]
Notes: [any issues or deviations]
```

## 7. Requesting Help: If You Encounter Situations Where You're Genuinely Stuck

Update your scratchpad with:

```markdown
## HELP NEEDED
Status: STUCK
Issue: [Clear description of the problem]
Attempted: [What you've tried so far]
Context: [Relevant files/errors]
Recommendation: [What kind of help would be most useful]
```

Then output JSON with status: "help_needed" to signal the supervisor

### You Can Also Request Specific Reviews

- "ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW_NEEDED" - For design decisions
- "SECURITY_REVIEW_NEEDED" - For security concerns
- "PERFORMANCE_REVIEW_NEEDED" - For optimization questions

## 8. Completion: When ALL TODOs Are Done

- Update the "Completion Summary" section in your scratchpad
- Include: what was completed (‚úÖ), issues encountered (‚ö†Ô∏è), follow-up suggestions (üí°)
- Output JSON with status: "success" to signal completion
