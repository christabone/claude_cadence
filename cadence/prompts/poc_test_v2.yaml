# POC Test File V2 - Tests anchor references to a separately loaded _common.yaml
# This approach loads _common.yaml separately and tests if anchors persist

# We'll test this differently - by having test content that references
# anchors that should be defined when _common.yaml is loaded first

# Test 1: Reference to simple anchor from _common.yaml
test_simple_ref: "*test_simple"

# Test 2: Reference to base paths anchor
paths_ref: "*base_paths"

# Test 3: Using merge keys with common anchors
context_with_merge:
  extra_field: "my custom value"
  # Will test if we can merge with <<: *var_project_context

# Test 4: Reference to template anchors
templates:
  serena: "*base_serena_activation"
  safety: "*base_safety_notice"
  scratchpad: "*base_scratchpad_template"

# Test 5: Multiple references
all_status:
  complete: "*tpl_status_complete"
  progress: "*tpl_status_progress"
  stuck: "*tpl_status_stuck"
