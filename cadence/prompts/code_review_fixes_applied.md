# Code Review Fixes Applied

## Summary
Applied all fixes identified by Gemini 2.5 Pro code review to ensure robustness and maintainability.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. ✅ Conflicting Agent Log Paths (CRITICAL)
**Fixed**: Unified agent log paths to use consistent location
- Line 59: `{{ project_path }}/.cadence/agent/output_{{ session_id }}.log` ✓ (kept as is)
- Line 72: Changed from `.cadence/logs/agent_{{ session_id }}.log` to `{{ project_path }}/.cadence/agent/output_{{ session_id }}.log`
- **Result**: Both references now point to the same log file location

### 2. ✅ Inconsistent Tool Name (HIGH)
**Fixed**: Standardized code review tool name
- Line 149: Changed from `mcp__zen__review` to `mcp__zen__codereview`
- **Result**: All references now use the official tool name `mcp__zen__codereview`

### 3. ✅ Hardcoded Model Names (MEDIUM)
**Fixed**: Replaced hardcoded model names with template variables from config.yaml
- Added to config.yaml:
  ```yaml
  zen_integration:
    primary_review_model: "gemini-2.5-pro"
    secondary_review_model: "o3"
    debug_model: "o3"
  ```
- Updated orchestrator-taskmaster.md:
  - Line ~167: `model="o3"` → `model="{{ debug_model }}"`
  - Line ~182: `model="o3"` → `model="{{ primary_review_model }}"`
  - Lines ~283-284: Updated both review calls to use template variables
- **Result**: Models can now be configured centrally in config.yaml

### 4. ✅ Inconsistent Path Usage (LOW)
**Fixed**: Already resolved as part of fix #1
- All paths now consistently use `{{ project_path }}` prefix for absolute paths

## Verification
All critical and high priority issues have been resolved:
- ✅ Agent log paths are now consistent
- ✅ Tool names are standardized to official names
- ✅ Model names are externalized to configuration
- ✅ All paths use absolute format with project_path

## Next Steps
The prompts are now ready for the !include functionality implementation in TaskMaster subtask 4.4.
