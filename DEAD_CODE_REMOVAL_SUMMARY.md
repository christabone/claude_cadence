# Dead Code Removal Summary - Claude Cadence Orchestrator

## Overview
Successfully removed ~400+ lines of dead code from `cadence/orchestrator.py`, reducing it from over 2000 lines to 1581 lines.

## Dead Code Removed

### 1. Dispatch System (Never Enabled)
The dispatch system was completely unused because `dispatch_enabled` was never set to True:
- `_handle_dispatch_code_review()` - 90 lines
- `_handle_dispatch_fix_required()` - 126 lines
- `_handle_dispatch_escalation()` - 83 lines
- `trigger_dispatch_code_review()` - 8 lines
- `_should_trigger_code_review()` - 33 lines
- `_agent_made_significant_changes()` - 17 lines

### 2. Workflow State Machine (Never Used)
The workflow state machine was initialized but never actually used for state transitions:
- `handle_workflow_transition()` - 104 lines
- `get_workflow_summary()` - 5 lines
- Workflow initialization code in `__init__` - 10 lines
- WorkflowState references throughout

### 3. Git File Detection (Only Used by Dispatch)
Methods only used by the dead dispatch system:
- `_get_recently_modified_files_async()` - 33 lines
- `_scan_recent_files_async()` - 49 lines
- `_get_recently_modified_files()` - 7 lines
- `_extract_modified_files()` - 28 lines

### 4. Duplicate Code
- Duplicate `AgentResult` dataclass definition (already imported from unified_agent)

### 5. Unused Imports
- `asyncio` (removed completely)
- WorkflowState/WorkflowContext imports (never existed but referenced)

## Architecture Insights

The dead code removal reveals the actual architecture:
1. **No Dispatch System**: The orchestrator uses direct zen MCP integration, not a dispatch-based approach
2. **No State Machine**: The orchestrator tracks state through simple variables, not a formal state machine
3. **Unified Agent**: There's only one agent class with configurable profiles, not separate dispatch agents
4. **Direct Zen Integration**: The supervisor calls zen tools directly via MCP, not through agent dispatch

## Benefits
- Reduced code complexity by ~25%
- Removed confusing architectural elements that were never used
- Clearer understanding of actual vs intended architecture
- Improved maintainability
