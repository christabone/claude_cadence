# Claude Cadence

**ðŸš§ UNDER CONSTRUCTION - NOT YET FUNCTIONAL ðŸš§**

A task-driven supervision system for Claude Code agent execution. Manages agent execution through Task Master integration, with agents working on TODOs until completion.

**Note: This project is actively being developed and is not ready for use. The architecture is being designed and core components are still being implemented.**

## Overview

Claude Cadence provides a framework for managing Claude Code agents through task-based execution. The supervisor uses Task Master to get and track tasks, then provides TODOs to agents who work until all tasks are complete or a maximum turn limit is reached.

## Features

- **Task-Driven Execution**: Agents work on specific TODOs from the supervisor
- **Task Master Integration**: Supervisor manages tasks using Task Master
- **Natural Completion**: Agents work until tasks are done, not until turns run out
- **Safety Limits**: Maximum turn limits prevent runaway execution
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor task completion and execution status via scratchpad files
- **Flexible Configuration**: YAML-based configuration for all settings
- **Enhanced Prompts**: Comprehensive agent context with safety-first design
- **Continuation Support**: Dynamic prompts for resumed execution with full context preservation
- **Zen MCP Integration**: Intelligent assistance when agents need help
  - Automatic stuck detection and debugging support
  - Code review and validation for critical tasks
  - Retrospective analysis for learning

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/christabone/claude_cadence.git
cd claude_cadence
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Minimal dependencies

# Check MCP servers are installed
python scripts/check_mcp_servers.py
```

## Quick Start

```python
from cadence import TaskSupervisor

# Create supervisor with max turns safety limit
supervisor = TaskSupervisor(max_turns=40)

# Run with Task Master integration
success = supervisor.run_with_taskmaster()
```

## How It Works

1. **Load Tasks**: Supervisor loads tasks from Task Master
2. **Create TODOs**: Convert incomplete tasks into TODO items for agent
3. **Execute**: Agent works on TODOs until complete or max turns reached
4. **Track Progress**: Monitor task completion through structured markers
5. **Update Status**: Update task status in Task Master when complete

**Key Philosophy**: Task completion drives the process. Agents work naturally until TODOs are done. Turn limits exist only as safety nets to prevent infinite loops.

## Architecture

Claude Cadence implements a supervisor-agent pattern where:

- **Supervisor** uses Task Master to manage tasks and track progress
- **Agent** receives TODOs and works until completion
- **Execution** continues until all tasks complete or safety limit is hit
- **No arbitrary checkpoints** - only task completion or safety limits stop execution

This ensures agents focus on completing work rather than managing execution windows.

### Prompt System

The prompt system prioritizes safety and reliability:

- **Full Context Preservation**: Every continuation includes complete agent context
- **Scratchpad Tracking**: Agents maintain progress in `.cadence/scratchpad/` files
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Prompts adjust based on completion status and issues
- **Safety-First Design**: Explicit warnings about `--dangerously-skip-permissions`

### Zen Integration

Claude Cadence integrates with zen MCP tools to provide assistance when agents encounter difficulties:

#### Help Protocol
Agents can request help by updating their scratchpad:
```markdown
## HELP NEEDED
Status: STUCK
Issue: [Description of the problem]
Attempted: [What has been tried]
Context: [Relevant files/errors]
```

Then declare "HELP NEEDED - STUCK" and exit. The supervisor will:
1. Detect the help request
2. Call appropriate zen tools (debug, review, etc.)
3. Generate continuation guidance
4. Resume execution with expert insights

#### Automatic Assistance
The supervisor automatically calls zen when:
- Same error occurs 3+ times (configurable)
- Agent uses >80% of max turns (configurable)
- Critical tasks match validation patterns
- Architecture/security/performance reviews are requested

## Configuration

Configuration is managed through `config.yaml`:

```yaml
execution:
  max_turns: 40         # Safety limit, not a target
  timeout: 600          # Execution timeout in seconds
  
agent:
  model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
  tools: ["bash", "read", "write", "edit", ...]
  
supervisor:
  model: "heuristic"    # or "claude-3-opus-latest" for LLM supervision
  verbose: true
  zen_integration:
    enabled: true
    stuck_detection: true
    auto_debug_threshold: 3     # Errors before calling zen
    retrospective_turn_threshold: 0.8  # 80% of max turns
    validate_on_complete:
      - "*security*"
      - "*database*"
      - "*critical*"
```
