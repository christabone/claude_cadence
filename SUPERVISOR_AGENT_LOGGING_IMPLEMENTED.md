# Supervisor and Agent Logging Implementation

## Changes Made

### 1. Supervisor Logging (orchestrator.py)
- Added code to save supervisor output after each run
- Location: Lines 289-303 in `run_claude_with_realtime_output` method
- Saves to: `.cadence/logs/<session_id>/supervisor.log`
- Appends to file with timestamp for each run

### 2. Agent Logging (unified_agent.py)
- Added code to save agent output after each run
- Location: Lines 374-389 in `_run_agent` method
- Saves to: `.cadence/logs/<session_id>/agent.log`
- Appends to file with timestamp for each run

## How It Works

1. Both supervisor and agent run as `claude` subprocesses
2. Their output is captured in `all_output` during execution
3. After execution completes, the output is written to log files
4. Each run is separated by timestamps and dividers

## Log File Structure

```
.cadence/logs/<session_id>/
├── supervisor.log    # All supervisor runs
└── agent.log        # All agent runs
```

## Benefits

- Full output from supervisor and agent is now preserved
- Can analyze code review output and decisions
- Can debug issues by examining the complete logs
- Timestamps help correlate events across components

## Testing

Run a task and check:
```bash
ls -la agr_mcp/.cadence/logs/*/
cat agr_mcp/.cadence/logs/*/supervisor.log
cat agr_mcp/.cadence/logs/*/agent.log
```

The supervisor.log should now contain the code review output with HIGH and CRITICAL findings that we were looking for!
