## Key Design Principles Applied
1. **Common Foundation:** Task 19 (JSON Envelope) serves as dependency for most other tasks
2. **Code Review Gates:** Each task ends with zen-powered code review against design doc
3. **Incremental Complexity:** Core file operations → MCP integration → HELP system → Monitoring
4. **Hobby-Level Focus:** Tasks scoped to essential functionality without overengineering

## Next Steps
1. Review existing codebase for duplicate functionality
2. Adjust tasks based on what's already implemented
3. Keep scope minimal and avoid overengineering
4. Focus on essential retry logic for JSON handoffs
