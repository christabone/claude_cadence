# Task 1: JSON Stream Monitor Implementation Summary

## What We Built
A minimal JSON stream monitor that handles multi-line JSON objects in Claude's streaming output.

## Simplified Approach
After code review feedback identified over-engineering in the original design, we pivoted to a much simpler implementation:

1. **Original Design**: 369+ lines with state machines, event systems, and complex error recovery
2. **Final Implementation**: 60 lines total with basic buffering

## Key Files Created

### 1. `cadence/json_stream_monitor.py` (60 lines)
- Simple class that accumulates text in a buffer
- Attempts JSON parsing after each line
- Returns complete JSON objects when found
- Clears buffer after successful parse

### 2. Integration in `cadence/orchestrator.py`
- Added import for SimpleJSONStreamMonitor
- Created monitor instance in `run_claude_with_realtime_output`
- Replaced try/except JSON parsing with `monitor.process_line()`
- Minimal changes to existing code structure

### 3. `tests/unit/test_json_stream_monitor.py`
- 6 simple unit tests covering:
  - Single-line JSON parsing
  - Multi-line JSON parsing
  - Buffer reset after success
  - Non-JSON line handling
  - Empty line handling
  - Reset method

## Benefits of Simple Approach
1. **Maintainable**: Easy to understand and modify
2. **Focused**: Solves the specific problem without extras
3. **Testable**: Simple logic is easy to test
4. **Performance**: Minimal overhead

## What We Avoided
- Complex state machines
- Event-driven architecture
- Advanced error recovery
- Buffer overflow handling
- JSON schema validation
- Performance metrics

## Result
A working solution that handles multi-line JSON in Claude's output with minimal complexity. The implementation is production-ready and can be enhanced later if needed.

Total implementation time: ~30 minutes vs estimated 2-3 hours for complex version.
