# Dead Code Verification Report

## Summary
After thorough verification, I've confirmed the dead code analysis with the following findings:

## Verified Dead Code

### 1. **workflow_state_machine.py** ✓ CONFIRMED DEAD
- No imports found anywhere in the codebase (excluding tests)
- No string references or dynamic imports detected
- Safe to remove

### 2. **review_trigger_detector.py** ✓ CONFIRMED DEAD
- No imports found anywhere in the codebase (excluding tests)
- No string references or dynamic imports detected
- Safe to remove

### 3. **agent_dispatcher.py** ❌ NOT DEAD - ACTIVELY USED
- Imported by `enhanced_agent_dispatcher.py`: `from .agent_dispatcher import AgentDispatcher`
- Imported by `agent_communication_handler.py`: `from .agent_dispatcher import AgentDispatcher`
- This is a base class that's extended by other modules
- **DO NOT REMOVE**

### 4. **TodoPromptManager class in prompts.py** ✓ CONFIRMED DEAD
- Only imported in `tests/conftest.py` but never used
- The import in conftest appears to be leftover from earlier development
- Safe to remove the class (but keep the import removal in conftest.py)

### 5. **Functions in code_review_agent.py** ✓ CONFIRMED DEAD
The following functions have no usage outside their definitions:
- `quick_review()`
- `get_review_history()`
- `format_review_summary()`
- `validate_review_request()`
- Safe to remove these functions

### 6. **zen_integration.py** ⚠️ PARTIALLY DEAD
- Imported in `__init__.py`: `from .zen_integration import ZenIntegration, ZenRequest`
- However, no actual usage of `ZenIntegration` or `ZenRequest` classes found
- Referenced in config structures (`zen_integration` config section)
- The config references suggest this might be planned functionality
- **Recommendation**: Keep for now, as it's part of the public API via `__init__.py`

## Recommendations

### Safe to Remove:
1. `workflow_state_machine.py` - entire file
2. `review_trigger_detector.py` - entire file
3. `TodoPromptManager` class from `prompts.py`
4. Dead functions from `code_review_agent.py`:
   - `quick_review()`
   - `get_review_history()`
   - `format_review_summary()`
   - `validate_review_request()`

### Keep:
1. `agent_dispatcher.py` - actively used as base class
2. `zen_integration.py` - part of public API, may be used by external code

### Additional Cleanup:
- Remove the unused `TodoPromptManager` import from `tests/conftest.py`
- Consider adding a comment to `zen_integration.py` indicating it's for future use if that's the case

## Verification Method
- Used grep to search for all imports and usage patterns
- Excluded test files and virtual environments
- Checked for dynamic imports and string references
- Verified actual usage vs just imports
