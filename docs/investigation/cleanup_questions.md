# Cleanup Completed - Summary

## Final Cleanup Actions:

### ✅ Completed Actions:
1. **Moved Scripts**:
   - `run_tests.sh` → `scripts/`

2. **Organized Documentation**:
   - `execution_context_refactor_plan.md` → `docs/design/`
   - Consolidated `TODO.md` into `docs/development/TODO.md`
   - Consolidated `docs/analysis/` into `docs/investigation/`

3. **Removed Accidental Directories**:
   - ✅ Removed entire `analysis/` directory from claude_cadence
   - This was created by accident and contained only:
     - Empty `kanban_756_mcp/` directory
     - Empty `work-in-progress/` directory
     - Duplicate copy of `agr_mcp/` that wasn't needed

4. **Entry Points**:
   - ✅ Kept `cadence.py` and `orchestrate.py` in root as entry points (per Chris's decision)

5. **agr_mcp Directory**:
   - ✅ Left untouched in root (per Chris's decision)

## Repository Structure is Now Clean!

The claude_cadence repository now has a proper structure with:
- Entry points in root
- Scripts in `scripts/`
- Documentation properly organized in `docs/`
- No accidental duplicate directories

The cleanup is complete and ready for comprehensive code review.
