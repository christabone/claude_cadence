# Code Review 2: Phase 3 TaskMaster Integration

## Review Date: 2025-06-28

## Objective
Verify Phase 3 implementation against TASKMASTER_INTEGRATION_SPEC.md requirements.

## Phase 3 Requirements Checklist

### ✅ 1. Add orchestrator support for 'get_next_task' action from supervisor
- **Status**: IMPLEMENTED
- **Location**: `/cadence/orchestrator.py` lines 1087-1090
- **Evidence**:
  ```python
  elif decision.action == "get_next_task":
      logger.info("Supervisor requesting next task from TaskMaster")
      # Continue to next iteration where supervisor will use TaskMaster MCP
      continue
  ```
- **Assessment**: Correctly implemented. When supervisor returns this action, orchestrator continues to next iteration.

### ✅ 2. Create supervisor prompt template for TaskMaster operations
- **Status**: ALREADY EXISTS
- **Location**: `/cadence/prompts/core/instructions/orchestrator-taskmaster.md`
- **Evidence**:
  - Full instructions for using TaskMaster MCP tools
  - Steps for getting tasks, finding next task, getting task details
  - Proper handling of subtasks and task context
- **Assessment**: Comprehensive template already in place with all necessary TaskMaster operations.

### ✅ 3. Modify supervisor prompt to use task context
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Location**: Multiple files in `/cadence/prompts/`
- **Evidence**:
  - All prompts use task_id, task_title, subtasks terminology
  - No references to old issue-based workflow
  - JSON output format includes task context fields
- **Assessment**: Task context fully integrated throughout prompt system.

## Additional Improvements Made

### ✅ 4. Updated JSON output format documentation
- **Location**: `/cadence/prompts/core/templates/output-format.md`
- **Changes**: Added explicit documentation for all 4 available actions including `get_next_task`
- **Assessment**: Clear examples for each action type with proper JSON structure.

### ✅ 5. Enhanced supervisor instructions
- **Location**: `/cadence/prompts/core/instructions/orchestrator-taskmaster.md`
- **Changes**: Added guidance for when to use `get_next_task` action
- **Assessment**: Clear instructions help supervisor decide when to defer task selection.

## Spec Compliance Check

### JSON Command Structure (Section 4)
- ✅ "execute" action includes all required fields: task_id, task_title, subtasks, project_path, session_id, guidance, reason
- ✅ "skip" action includes required fields: session_id, reason
- ✅ "complete" action includes required fields: session_id, reason
- ✅ "get_next_task" action supported with session_id, reason

### Supervisor Behavior (Section 3.2)
- ✅ Calls get_tasks to see project state
- ✅ Calls next_task to find next available task
- ✅ Calls get_task with withSubtasks=true
- ✅ Extracts pending subtasks into TODO list
- ✅ Returns proper JSON decision

### Task Context Usage
- ✅ task_id properly tracked through workflow
- ✅ task_title included in execute decisions
- ✅ subtasks array replaces old todos structure
- ✅ project_path (internally project_root in JSON) properly passed

## Code Quality Assessment

### Strengths
1. Clean integration with existing orchestrator flow
2. Backward compatibility maintained where appropriate
3. Clear separation of concerns between orchestrator and supervisor
4. Comprehensive prompt templates with good documentation

### Areas for Attention
1. The `get_next_task` action simply continues the loop - ensure supervisor understands this will trigger a new iteration
2. JSON parsing uses SimpleJSONStreamMonitor which is robust for handling streaming output

## Verification Tests Performed

1. ✅ Verified no --issue references remain in code
2. ✅ Confirmed supervisor prompt includes TaskMaster MCP usage
3. ✅ Checked JSON output format documentation is complete
4. ✅ Validated orchestrator handles all 4 action types

## Conclusion

Phase 3 implementation is **COMPLETE** and fully compliant with TASKMASTER_INTEGRATION_SPEC.md requirements. All three Phase 3 tasks have been successfully implemented:

1. Orchestrator support for 'get_next_task' action ✅
2. Supervisor prompt template for TaskMaster operations ✅
3. Supervisor prompt using task context ✅

The system is ready to proceed to Phase 4.

## Recommendations

1. Consider adding debug logging when `get_next_task` is used frequently (might indicate supervisor confusion)
2. The JSON retry logic (max 5 retries) is good for handling formatting errors
3. Phase 4 should focus on zen_mcp_codereview integration which appears partially implemented

## Next Steps

Proceed with Phase 4:
- Verify JSON command parsing for zen_mcp_codereview
- Connect code review triggers to task completion
