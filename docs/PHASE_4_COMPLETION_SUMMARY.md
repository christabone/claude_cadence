# Phase 4 Completion Summary

## Date: 2025-06-28

## Phase 4 Objectives
1. Verify JSON command parsing for zen_mcp_codereview
2. Connect code review triggers to task completion

## Key Findings

### 1. JSON Command Parsing for zen_mcp_codereview ✅

**Implementation Added:**
- Added handler in orchestrator.py (lines 1199-1211) for `zen_mcp_codereview` action
- Updated output format documentation to include the new action type
- Action structure includes: task_id, review_scope, session_id, reason

**How it Works:**
- Supervisor returns this action after calling zen MCP tools directly
- Orchestrator logs the code review request and continues to next iteration
- This is a signal action, not a trigger - the supervisor has already performed the review

### 2. Code Review Connection to Task Completion ✅

**Already Fully Implemented:**
- Code review triggers are controlled by `zen_integration.code_review_frequency` in config.yaml
- When set to "task", supervisor receives comprehensive code review instructions
- Supervisor is instructed to:
  1. Do their own code review first
  2. Update task status to "done" if review passes
  3. Call zen MCP tools for AI-powered reviews (o3 and gemini-2.5-pro)
  4. Handle critical issues by reverting task to "in-progress" if needed

**Code Review Flow:**
1. Agent completes all TODOs for a task
2. Supervisor analyzes the work
3. Based on code_review_frequency setting, supervisor gets appropriate instructions
4. For "task" frequency: Supervisor performs 3-way review (self, o3, gemini)
5. Supervisor either marks task complete or creates new TODOs for critical fixes
6. Optionally returns zen_mcp_codereview action to signal review happened

## Configuration Details

From config.yaml:
```yaml
zen_integration:
  code_review_frequency: "task"  # Options: none, task, project
  primary_review_model: "gemini-2.5-pro"
  secondary_review_model: "o3"
```

## Integration Points

1. **Prompt System**:
   - `code-review-task.md` - Task-level review instructions
   - `code-review-project.md` - Project-level review instructions
   - Instructions dynamically included based on code_review_frequency

2. **Orchestrator**:
   - Builds supervisor prompt with appropriate code review sections
   - Handles zen_mcp_codereview action when returned
   - Continues workflow after code review

3. **Supervisor**:
   - Receives detailed instructions on when/how to review
   - Calls zen MCP tools directly
   - Decides whether to continue or fix issues

## Verification

The implementation satisfies all requirements from TASKMASTER_INTEGRATION_SPEC.md:

1. ✅ Code reviews trigger based on config settings after task completion
2. ✅ Supervisor can issue zen_mcp_codereview commands that orchestrator recognizes
3. ✅ Review results are logged but don't block task progression
4. ✅ Critical issues can trigger task status reversion and re-execution

## Conclusion

Phase 4 is **COMPLETE**. The system already had comprehensive code review integration through the prompt system. We added support for the zen_mcp_codereview action to allow supervisors to signal when reviews occur.

The implementation elegantly handles code reviews through supervisor instructions rather than orchestrator-driven triggers, giving the supervisor full control over the review process while maintaining proper task status management through TaskMaster.

## Next Steps

Proceed to Phase 5: Test complete workflow end-to-end
